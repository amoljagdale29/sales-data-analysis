# sales-data-analysis

followed this tutorial [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4) 

In this we have 1yr data of sales of electronics store

with order datetime,order id,product, price each, quantity

From this data we tried to answer few questions

- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?

Did some data cleaning and added some derived columns

Used pandas to wrangle with data and plot data using pandas ploting
which uses matplotlib in backend
